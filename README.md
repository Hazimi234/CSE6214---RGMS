Make sure you download Flask before running this project:
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-flask

Install the necessary files in the vscode terminal or command prompt:
pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy flask-bcrypt flask-migrate

The files "create_admin.py" and "create_users.py" are for creating the users faster and easier simply by just running the file:
python create_admin.py OR py create_admin.py

To run the main system, type:
python main.py OR py main.py

You should see output indicating the server is running, usually:
Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000

Go to that link in order to use this system.
